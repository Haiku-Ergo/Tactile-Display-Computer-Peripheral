This is a repo for a computer peripheral that can help blind people feel a computer screen.

Right now there are just some fabrication files, but I'll add some math documents and a few example functions in python or something.

I haven't finished the project so I dont have much software yet.


I want this information to be free to anyone who wants it. I'm putting an MIT license on it.

# Summary of Project:
- Represent pixels with pins
  - Instead of adjusting brightness for a pixel, the display adjusts height of a pin.
  - Text may be unreadable, but regions of text and general shapes should be visible.
  - The display is a relatively small 2D grid of pins with 10x10 resolution and 10mm/pin densiy.
- Motion
  - The display tracks position and rotation.
  - To feel different parts of the display, simply move the display like a mouse. (But it also tracks rotation)
  - Zoom in or out to feel the forest or the trees.
